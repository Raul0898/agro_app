# Dart Analysis & Formatting Fix Report

## Baseline
- `flutter analyze` could not be executed because the Flutter SDK is not available in the execution environment (`command not found`).
- As a result, no automated list of analyzer findings was produced.

## Actions Taken
- Replaced `print` debug statements with `debugPrint` across authentication and home screens to satisfy the `avoid_print` lint while preserving logging.
- Added the corresponding `package:flutter/foundation.dart` imports where needed.
- Removed `// ignore: avoid_print` directives that were masking lint issues.
- Ensured asynchronous callbacks check `context.mounted` before using the build context in `analisis_suelo_page.dart`, removing the need for `use_build_context_synchronously` ignores.
- Normalized import grouping/order in `main.dart` to follow Dart style conventions (dart -> package -> relative).
- Recorded analyzer command attempts in `tooling/_baseline_analyze.txt` and `tooling/_postfix_analyze.txt` to document the environment limitation.

## Post-fix Status
- Analyzer still cannot run in this environment due to the missing Flutter SDK, so automated verification is pending.
- Manual reasoning indicates the addressed lints should now pass once the SDK is available.

## Modified Files
- `lib/main.dart`
- `lib/home_page.dart`
- `lib/features/auth/ui/login_page.dart`
- `lib/features/auth/ui/pages/selector_contexto_page.dart`
- `lib/features/auth/ui/pages/personal_info_page.dart`
- `lib/features/auth/ui/pages/registro_usuario_page.dart`
- `lib/features/auth/ui/pages/analisis_suelo_page.dart`
- `tooling/_baseline_analyze.txt`
- `tooling/_postfix_analyze.txt`
- `analysis_fix_report.md`

## Commands Executed
```
flutter --version
flutter pub get
flutter analyze > tooling/_baseline_analyze.txt || true
dart fix --apply
dart format lib
flutter analyze > tooling/_postfix_analyze.txt || true
```
_All commands that rely on the Flutter/Dart SDK failed with `command not found` because the tooling is unavailable in the execution environment._

## Follow-up
- Re-run `flutter pub get`, `dart fix --apply`, `dart format lib`, and `flutter analyze` locally (with the Flutter SDK installed) to confirm that all analyzer warnings are resolved and formatting is consistent.
